# Replication-heatwaves-mortality-and-adaptation-in-France
- These files contain all the codes used to create the database and replicate the results of the study : "Heatwaves, mortality and adaptation in France" salesse, 2024.
- The files are sequentially numbered, from the first steps in creating the database to the codes for replicating the econometric results.
- As the database is too large to import directly to github, I'm currently looking for a way to make it directly open source by other means.
